                <p>I am a third year Neuroscience student whose main ambition is to help make RED  a truly one of a kind club on campus. RED has the potential of providing a new and innovative approach towards the way we educate students about substance abuse. Aside from providing educational classroom visits, I want to ensure that everyone involved within RED is having a great time and really enjoying being a part of the team. In my free time I enjoy being active, hanging out with friends, and learning new things! If you ever have any questions, and want to learn more about myself or the club, please don’t hesitate to contact us at reducalgary@gmail.com</p>

                <p>I am in my 3rd year of Neurosciences at the University of Calgary. I have always been passionate about the need to make science accessible and understandable to the general public. After spending close to a year working hands-on in an Addiction Neuroscience research laboratory, I found myself intrigued by the development and effects of addiction. This led to the formation of RED, through which we hope to effectively communicate the scientific basis of drug addiction, and all associated risks. If you have any questions, or would like to learn more, please contact us at reducalgary@gmail.com.</p>

                <p>I am currently enrolled in a Biological Sciences major at the University of Calgary. My current roles as VP External for RED include: facilitating the communication between elementary and junior-high schools, coordinating presentation dates, club objectives and ensuring that the presentations meet the criteria/requirements for the schools. RED allows parents and teachers to give their children a strong scientific foundation in the effects of drugs, allowing them to further make better decisions when encountered with drugs. My hobbies outside of RED include frequenting the gym, painting or spending time with friends and family.</p>

                <p>I am a third year Bioinformatics student learning computer programming while pursuing my passions in biology. One of the aspects of biology that fascinates me is the brain. It has the capacity to learn, understand and apply. Although today we are still unable to know how the whole brain functions, we have discovered many intresting properties of the brain. At the moment recreational drugs is one of the simplest concepts to learn yet very interesting. It is fascinating to know how the body reacts to these reagents and how we become addicted. In this club I will be ensuring the smooth operation of IT. I hope with this information we can educate teens, so they can make informed decisions.</p>

                <p>My name is Megan and I recently completed by BSc majoring in Biological Sciences. This fall I will be working towards my BEd specializing in Elementary Sciences at the University of Calgary, Werklund School of Education. My passion is teaching sciences using a variety of hands-on, creative methods to enhance understanding of given topics. My role at RED is Director of Education and involves creating presentations that are both interactive and understandable for junior high students. I aim to continuously work towards improving our presentations to meet the needs of each individual audience we encounter in the past, present and future. I believe RED will play an important role in keeping students informed using scientific reasoning of effects of drugs on the brain. In my free time I enjoy baking, art and spending time with friends and family.</p>

For me, communicating science to the general public and seeing the impact it has on individuals who previously had no interest in science motivated me to join RED. Likewise, RED’s mission to flip the script on how we educate students ’s on substance abuse and provide a new perspective focusing on the biology is another reason I decided to be a part of RED. In terms of my position, I am responsible for managing and maintaining all financial matters of the club, as well as establish partnerships with potential sponsors who can support us and ensure our on-going success. In my free time, I enjoy playing different sports like cricket, soccer, badminton, as well as meet new people and volunteer in the community.</p>

                <p>Hi! My name is Hasnaien and I am a second year Biological Sciences Student specializing in Plant Biology. I find it very unfortunate how so few youths are invested in their education and hope our efforts here at R.E.D. can help foster a passion for learning and discovery in the students to whom we present. If even a single student was inspired towards greater engagement in their studies past the point of “just getting by”, I would be absolutely overjoyed. As a Junior Executive, it’s my job to support the Executives in any way they could possibly need, and help ensure the smooth functioning of the club in terms of maintaining our standards of quality and punctuality. In my free time (when I get any), I enjoy hitting the gym and expanding my music taste.</p>

As a junior executive I’m excited to work alongside amazing peers and students who can share their wealth of knowledge and expertise in this unique mentorship opportunity. In my free time you can find me playing basketball, hiking in the mountains, organizing friends and family, or volunteering with local organizations.</p>

By targeting teenagers and expanding their knowledge on the potential side effects of drugs, I share RED’s passion of combating substance abuse in teenagers. </p>

                <p>Hi, my name is Suman and I am a first-year Kinesiology major. My interest with substance abuse issues began at a young age when I witnessed my peers experimenting with drugs. Over the years, their habits progressed and drugs became a part of their lifestyle. Witnessing first-hand the impact that substance abuse has on youth has driven me to take a stand and educate a younger audience. My goal and purpose on this team is to make sure that the next generation of students get the opportunity to learn about substance abuse in a way that was not made available to me or my peers. Through engaging presentations and interactive learning, I hope to inform the younger generation about the science, and knowledge of drugs and substances. I would also like to introduce the world of science to youth at a younger age as it is one of the fastest-growing and innovative industries. In my spare time, I love to listen to rap music, explore the food options on the Food Network, and craft small artisanal birdhouses</p>

                <p>I am in my fourth year of Computer Science, concentrating my studies in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary. In this area of study, objective understanding of the potential consequences of my actions are vital in making well-informed decisions. However, it is not a requirement to be a critical thinker to make well-informed decisions. Speaking from experience, understanding the foundational basics can largely assist in mitigating several consequences and misunderstandings. I hope this will enable youths to take that first, possibly intimidating, step in trying to understand complex topics - such as the effects of drugs. Through my involvement in RED, I also hope to reflect the team’s passionate efforts in this endeavor, in person and on the website. I also enjoy a good pun and when I have free time, I love to spend it with good company!</p>
