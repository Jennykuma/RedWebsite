                        Yesterday, RED had the privilege to deliver nine presentations to junior high school students in grades 7-9, attending Georges P. Vanier. It would not have been possible without our lovely RED club volunteers and we would like to thank each one of you for your continuous dedication and commitment! In terms of the in-class presentations, we were glad to hear about the heightened interest and engagement involving the activities planned and information conveyed by RED. Students were exposed to a variety of material from covering the role of the neurons in the brain to how different substances, such as alcohol, affect an individual’s behavior. Students also got the opportunity to take part in reaction time tests, engage in a debate surrounding a popular topic, and enjoyed diagnosing “patients” in our “Patient Overdose Investigation” activity. Overall, the presentations were an incredible experience and we look forward to the presentations planned in the near future!!

                    <p>Our first set of presentations was a success. Several members of the club were able to prepare and present a total of five presentations to grade 8 and 9 classes at RT Alderman Middle school. The feedback we received was all positive and we are looking forward to going back next year with updated presentations. RED is constantly working on research and development to keep our presentations up to date and relevant.</p>

                        Thanks to the Neuroscience Student Association (NSA) for wanting to collaborate with us for the <i>"Adult Only Night"</i> at Telus Spark on November 10th! Although RED is mainly focused on educating the youth, we were able to expand our horizon and try to implement our activities with a bit of an older audience. With the support of the NSA, we hosted a fantastic event which participants seemed to really enjoy. Many learned new things, some tried to diagnose patients while others were too busy being competitive in our reaction-time test. All in all, it was a lot of fun informing the general public about the science of drugs! Stay tuned for more updates!

                        We had an amazing bake sale in which we raised roughly $200 that would be used to purchase materials for our presentations at our schools. Some of the money was also used to subsidize the cost of our new crewnecks for our members that are presenting. We want to personally thank anyone that contributed to the bake sale - especially Megan, with her awesome macarons!

                        On behalf of the executive team at RED, we want to thank everyone who attended the Meet and Greet on the 28th. We had a blast networking and meeting our new members, while enjoying some pizza! This year we have the opportunity to present at RT Alderman Junior high. We hope that with our hard work over the summer, we can deliver an amazing presentation in the coming weeks.
