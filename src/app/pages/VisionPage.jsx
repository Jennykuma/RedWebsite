        <h2>What We Are About</h2>
        <p>The annual costs of substance abuse are enormous - $40 Billion in Canada (Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse). Despite the implementation of substance abuse awareness campaigns, drug offences (per 100, 000 population) have been increasing since the early 1990â€™s (Statistics Canada, 2009). Unfortunately, substance abuse is still a major obstacle that must be overcome. <b>RED (Reforming Education on Drugs)</b> was established at the University of Calgary with hopes to combat substance abuse by educating the early-teens population. We believe in education with an emphasis on science, while taking social views into understanding as well. Through interactive presentations, we hope to establish, in students, a foundational understanding of the biological and neurological mechanisms involved in substance use. This approach allows us to engage students in a discussion and effectively communicate the consequences of substance abuse. By discussing substance abuse in an objective and scientific manner, we believe students will come to their own conclusions and hold themselves accountable.</p>
