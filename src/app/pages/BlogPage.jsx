                RED WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A HUGE THANK YOU SHOUTOUT TO DEVON FOR ITS CONTRIBUTIONS OF $1500.00!
                <br /> Your generous financial support is greatly appreciated. With your contribution, RED will be able to allot more
                resources for a greater number of presentations in the school year (RED has 50 tentative presentations booked
                already), purchase more materials for the in-class presentations, and create a sense of team pride within RED
                through the distribution of customized RED crewnecks. The generous support of individuals and groups like you
                make it possible for our club to implement our vision regarding substance awareness and is an encouraging reminder
                of why we undoubtedly enjoy giving back to our community.

                variety of neuroscience related topics, RED has definitely knocked these presentations out of the ballpark! We
                would once again like to thank our hard working volunteers who have taken time out from their well-deserved summer
                break and have contributed towards such a great educational experience! Hope you all have a relaxing summer and
                be sure to look forward to more presentations and events RED has planned in the near future!

                RED can add another presentation to it is done list! RED recently collaborated with LINKages this past weekend and had the
                opportunity to lead interactive activities aimed at informing seniors about several common drugs and their effects
                on one‚Äôs brain and behavior. Topics such as substance misuse and addiction were explored through interactions
                among participants and throughout the event. To start off the event, LINKages participants were first asked series
                of trivia questions regarding biological pathways and the role of neurons. In the latter half, participants learned
                about familiar drugs and found themselves engaged in an insightful discussion surrounding the legalization of
                marijuana to conclude the day! All in all, RED received a lot of positive feedback from the participants and
                hopes to collaborate with LINKages in the near future! A huge shout out to our hardworking RED club volunteers-
                we cannot thank you enough!

                On February 23rd, RED had the privilege to deliver nine presentations to junior high school students in grades 7-9, attending
                Georges P. Vanier. It would not have been possible without our lovely RED club volunteers and we would like to
                thank each one of you for your continuous dedication and commitment! In terms of the in-class presentations,
                we were glad to hear about the heightened interest and engagement involving the activities planned and information
                conveyed by RED. Students were exposed to a variety of material from covering the role of the neurons in the
                brain to how different substances, such as alcohol, affect an individual‚Äôs behavior. Students also got the opportunity
                to take part in reaction time tests, engage in a debate surrounding a popular topic, and enjoyed diagnosing ‚Äúpatients‚Äù
                in our ‚ÄúPatient Overdose Investigation‚Äù activity. Overall, the presentations were an incredible experience and
                we look forward to the presentations planned in the near future!!

                Thanks to the Neuroscience Student Association (NSA) for wanting to collaborate with us for the
                <i>"Adult Only Night"</i> at Telus Spark on November 10th! Although RED is mainly focused on educating the youth,
                we were able to expand our horizon and try to implement our activities with a bit of an older audience. With
                the support of the NSA, we hosted a fantastic event which participants seemed to really enjoy. Many learned new
                things, some tried to diagnose patients while others were too busy being competitive in our reaction-time test.
                All in all, it was a lot of fun informing the general public about the science of drugs! Stay tuned for more
                updates!
