          <p>Weâ€™re a club at the University of Calgary called Reforming Education of Drugs (RED for short) and our primary goal is to provide in-class educational sessions for the youth regarding drug abuse prevention. Through the means of interactive scientific demonstrations and presentations, we will establish a foundational understanding of the biological/neurological mechanisms involved in drug addiction and the social implications involved.</p>
